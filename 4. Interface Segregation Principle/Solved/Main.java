/*
To solve the problem, We will follow the interface segregation principle and refactor the original interface.
Then we will create two or more other interfaces, as necessary â€” one for Swimming athletes, others for Racers, High Jumpers etc.
Thus, no client is forced to depend on methods it doesn't use. So our code will follow the Interface Segregation Principle.
