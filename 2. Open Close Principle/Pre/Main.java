/*
The open/closed principle (OCP) states that a module should be open to extension but closed for modification.
We are creating a simple calculator module with only two operations addition and subtraction.
Now if a developer wants to add the capability of multiplication â€“ he has to change the 'Main' class code and the method calculate(). 
Thus, this code does not follow the Open-closed Principle.
